## Download data

Before running any simulation or learning you need to download the data from `quandl.com`. You can do so by executing the script

```
python download_data.py
```

Note that you need `pytables` and `quandl` packages for it to work.


## Compute learning data

To solve learning problem we need to compute the learning data by simulating the stocks over a certain time period

```
python compute_learning_data.py
```
